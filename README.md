## Introduction

The main objective of this project is to make it easier for people to understand how different algorithms work by visualizing them in a simple and interactive way. The application currently supports the following algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Algorithm


## Features

Some of the features of the Algorithm Visualizer are:

- Interactive animations to visualize the algorithms
- Option to change the speed of the animation
- Option to choose between path finding or sorting algorithms
- Seperate tage for the algorithms in order to get better understanding of how algorithms work and visualize it. 

## Installation and Usage

To install and use the Algorithm Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-visualizer.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory using the command `cd algorithm-visualizer`
3. Install the dependencies using the command `npm install`
4. Start the application using the command `npm start`
